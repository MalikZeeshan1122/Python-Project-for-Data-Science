# Intro to Web Scraping Using BeautifulSoup
Certainly! Web scraping is the process of extracting information from websites. It involves fetching the web page and then extracting the desired information from the HTML content. BeautifulSoup is a Python library that provides tools for web scraping by making it easy to extract information from HTML or XML documents.

Here's a brief overview of using BeautifulSoup for web scraping:

# Step 1: Install BeautifulSoup
Before you start, make sure to install BeautifulSoup. You can do this using pip:


# pip install beautifulsoup4

# Step 2: Fetching the Web Page
You'll need to fetch the HTML content of the web page you want to scrape. You can use the requests library for this.


import requests

url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    html_content = response.text
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve the web page.")
Step 3: Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup
Once you have the HTML content, use BeautifulSoup to parse it and navigate through the document's structure.

python
Copy code
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

# Extracting data using BeautifulSoup methods
title = soup.title  # Get the title of the page
all_paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')  # Find all paragraphs

# Find elements by class or id
specific_div = soup.find('div', class_='example-class')
Step 4: Extracting Information
Now that you have parsed the HTML, you can extract the information you need.

python
Copy code
# Extract text content from an element
print("Title:", title.text)

# Extract attributes from an element
link = soup.find('a')
print("Link URL:", link['href'])
Example: Scraping Quotes from a Website
Here's a simple example that scrapes quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com:

python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "http://quotes.toscrape.com"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    html_content = response.text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

    # Extracting quotes and authors
    quotes = soup.find_all('span', class_='text')
    authors = soup.find_all('small', class_='author')

    for quote, author in zip(quotes, authors):
        print(f"\"{quote.text}\" - {author.text}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve the web page.")
Remember to respect the terms of service of the website you're scraping and be mindful of the legal and ethical considerations surrounding web scraping. Always check the 
website's robots.txt file for scraping guidelines, and ensure you are not violating any terms of use.

# Project Overview
For this project, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Your job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

# Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this assignment. We will be using Plotly in this course for data visualization and is not a requirement to take this course.

In the Python for Data Science, AI and Development course you utilized Skills Network Labs for hands-on labs.

For this project you will use Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio. Skills Network Labs is a sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in courses. Whereas Watson Studio, a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers and domain experts to develop and deploy your projects.

# Review criteria

There are two hands-on labs on Extracting Stock Data and one assignment to complete. You will be judged by completing two quizzes and one peer review assignment. The quizzes will test you based on the output of the hands-on labs. In the peer review assignment you will share and take screen shots of the outcomes of your assignment.
